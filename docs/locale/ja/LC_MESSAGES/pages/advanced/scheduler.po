"iamai's scheduled tasks are implemented using the "

"After loading the adapter, for plugins that need to be executed on a "

msgstr ""

#: ../../pages/advanced/scheduler.md:90
msgid ""
"Scheduled plugins must have the `__schedule__`, `trigger`, and "

#: ../../pages/advanced/scheduler.md:92

"`__schedule__` must be set to True. `trigger` represents the APScheduler "

#: ../../pages/advanced/scheduler.md:106
msgid ""
"This event's `type` attribute is always apscheduler, and it has a "
"`plugin_class` attribute representing the plugin class that defined this "
"scheduled task. You can use `type(self) == self.event.plugin_class` in "
"the `rule()` method to ensure that this plugin only handles its own "

"When the same scheduled task needs to wake up multiple plugins "

"You need to set a unique `scheduler_flag` attribute for the plugin that "
"defines the scheduled task. Of course, this attribute can also be named "
"anything else. Then the second plugin can determine the value of "
"`scheduler_flag` to judge whether the current event is a scheduled event "
"defined by the first plugin."
