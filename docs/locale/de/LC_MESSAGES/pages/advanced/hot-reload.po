"iamai provides a `restart()` method to exit and restart the iamai. You "
"can write a plugin like this to restart iamai:"

"One detail to note is that using this function and manually exiting and "
"restarting iamai have some subtle differences, mainly in that using this "
"function will not clear plugin and global states."

"In addition, iamai also provides a `reload_plugins()` method to reload "

"Since version 0.4.0, iamai has supported automatic hot reload. This means"
" that when plugin files or configuration files are updated, iamai does "
"not need to be restarted, and the changes will be automatically loaded."

"This feature requires support from the `watchfiles` library, so please "
"manually install this Python library."

"When the configuration file is updated, the configuration file will be "
"reloaded. If the bot table changes, the `restart()` method will be called"
" to restart iamai."

#: ../../pages/advanced/hot-reload.md:40
msgid ""
"When plugin files in the directories set in `plugin_dirs` are added, "
"modified, or deleted, iamai will automatically try to import, reload, or "
"delete the corresponding plugins."

"Enabling this feature is very simple, just pass the `hot_reload` "
"parameter when instantiating the `Bot` class."

"However, please note that this feature is still in early experimental "
"stage. If you encounter any issues during use, please provide feedback. "
"Also, this feature may slightly affect performance, so if your use case "
"is highly performance-sensitive, do not enable this feature in production"
" environments."
